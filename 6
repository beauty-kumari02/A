TOWER OF HANOI
% Base case: only one disk
hanoi(1, Source, Destination, _) :-
    write('Move disk from '),
    write(Source),
    write(' to '),
    write(Destination),
    nl.

% Recursive case: more than one disk
hanoi(N, Source, Destination, Auxiliary) :-
    N > 1,
    M is N - 1,

    % Step 1: Move N-1 disks from Source to Auxiliary
    hanoi(M, Source, Auxiliary, Destination),

    % Step 2: Move the largest disk from Source to Destination
    write('Move disk from '),
    write(Source),
    write(' to '),
    write(Destination),
    nl,

    % Step 3: Move N-1 disks from Auxiliary to Destination
    hanoi(M, Auxiliary, Destination, Source).
    
OUTPUT:?- hanoi(3, left, right, center).
Move disk from left to right
Move disk from left to center
Move disk from right to center
Move disk from left to right
Move disk from center to left
Move disk from center to right
Move disk from left to right

2(N-Queen Problem)
% Entry point: generate a solution for N queens

% Check that all queens are safely placed

% Ensure one queen does not attack others

safe_queen(Q, [Q1|Qs], D) :-
    Q #\= Q1,              % not in same column
    abs(Q - Q1) #\= D,     % not on same diagonal
    D1 #= D + 1,
